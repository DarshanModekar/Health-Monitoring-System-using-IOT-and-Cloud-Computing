# ⚙️ Technologies Used
IoT sensors for data collection

Python for backend and data handling

Cloud platforms (like Firebase / AWS / Google Cloud)

# Plan and need for optimizaton
To enhance the functionality and user experience of the health monitoring system, we will be implementing a dedicated mobile application. This app will integrate with ThingSpeak to provide real-time data visualization and improved accessibility. By using the app:
Users will be able to monitor their health parameters directly on their smartphones.
Notifications and alerts will be delivered instantly.
The app will reduce dependency on the ThingSpeak web interface, offering a more optimized and user-friendly solution for managing health data.
This implementation will ensure seamless connectivity and better optimization for end-users.
